# indoor-locationing-with-WiFi-data
The task is to train models to predict the location of a smart phone in a multi story multi building campus using WiFi signal strength. There is a training data set containing app. 20k observations and 520 WAPs (Wireless Access Points). My models are validated on the validation data set that contains the same count of WAPs and app. 11k observations. 

KNN, Random Forest and Neural Network models are fitted. Random Forest and Neural Networks deliver better accuracy than KNN.
